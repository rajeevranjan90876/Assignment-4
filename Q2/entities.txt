HTML entities are special codes or sequences of characters used in HTML to represent reserved characters, 
characters with special meaning, or characters that cannot be easily typed on a keyboard. 
They are essential for ensuring proper rendering of text and avoiding conflicts with HTML syntax. 

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

&lt; and &gt;: These entities represent the less-than (<) and greater-than (>) symbols, respectively. 
                They are used to display these symbols on a webpage without triggering HTML tag interpretation.

&amp;: This entity represents the ampersand (&). It is used to display an ampersand character 
        and prevents it from being interpreted as the start of an HTML entity.

&quot;: This entity represents the double quotation mark ("). It is used to display double quotation marks within attribute values of HTML tags, 
        especially in cases where you need to specify attribute values within double quotes.

&apos;: While less common, this entity represents the single quotation mark or apostrophe ('). 
        It is used in situations where single quotation marks need to be displayed without causing issues in HTML attributes.

&nbsp;: This entity represents a non-breaking space. 
        It is used to create space between words or elements that should not be broken by word wrapping. 
        It ensures that text remains on the same line.
