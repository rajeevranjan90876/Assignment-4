3 way to improving the accessibility of HTML

Use Semantic HTML Elements: As mentioned earlier, HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer>. 
                            Utilize these elements to provide a clear and meaningful structure to your content, 
                            making it easier for assistive technologies and search engines to understand.

Provide Descriptive Text for Images: Always include descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images using the alt attribute. 
                                        This allows screen readers to convey the content and purpose of images to visually impaired users.

Use ARIA Roles and Attributes: The Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) specification provides additional attributes and 
                                roles that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility. 
                                For example, you can use role="button" to make a non-button element act like a button.
