    <h1>Difference Between HTML and HTML5</h1>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>HTML</th>
            <th>HTML5</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Previous versions of HTML required a complex Document Type Definition (DTD) declaration, such as !DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN".</td>
            <td>HTML5 uses a simplified !DOCTYPE html declaration, making it easier to include in documents and reducing the likelihood of syntax errors.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Earlier versions of HTML had fewer semantic elements, making it challenging to provide meaningful structure to web content.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like header, nav, main, article, section, and footer. These elements provide a clearer structure and improve the accessibility and SEO of web pages.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Previous HTML versions required third-party plugins like Adobe Flash for multimedia content.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements (audio and video), eliminating the need for plugins and providing better compatibility with modern browsers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Earlier HTML versions didn't provide native support for multi-threading.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced Web Workers, which enable background processing and improve the responsiveness of web applications.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>WebSockets were not available in earlier HTML versions.</td>
            <td>HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API, enabling full-duplex communication between the client and server over a single, long-lived connection.</td>
